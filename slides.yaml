  title: Secret project status
  status: |
    It was determined that is not possible to solve problems
    with secrets without doing some foundational changes
  why: |
    Our platform is not flexible enough to allow us make 
    changes in a timely fashion.
  in other words: |
    Our hability to make platform changes is slower than
    what the business requires.
  real life examples:
  - aws resource provisioning
  - mysql secret rotation
  - reaper
  - new environment creation ( testing/staging/MT )
  - accounting
