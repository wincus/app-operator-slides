  title: What is Infrastructure as Data?
  answer: |
    While Infrastructure as code (IaC) describes the desired
    state in a language program syntax, Infrastructure as Data (IaD)
    describes the desired state with plain no-code data. Then 
    a control loop ( or controller ) makes sure the desired state
    is reconciled.
